# docker-bash

This is a quick menu for starting bash on docker containers.

## Installation

The "dialog" package is required, available from fine repositories everywhere:

brew install dialog

apt install dialog

If the year is 1995 and you're running Slackware, you probably already have it installed.


## Usage

Stash the script somewhere handy and run when needed.

Create an alias for the ultimate in productivity:

alias db="bash ~/somewhere/docker-bash/docker-bash.sh"
